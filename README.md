## Project introduction
This code is a simple student management system that allows the user to add, list, find, and remove students. 



## Quick revision
The program consists of two classes:

1 - Student: 
The Student class has four attributes: name, ID, grade, and address.


2 - StudentSystem: class has four methods
<br>
- add_student()
<br>
- list_students()
<br>
- find_student()
<br>
- remove_student()



## Features 
The add_student() method prompts the user to enter the student's details, validates the input, and creates a new Student object.
The list_students() method prints the details of all the students that have been added.
The find_student() method prompts the user to enter the ID of the student they want to find, searches for the student with the given ID, and prints their details.
The remove_student() method prompts the user to enter the ID of the student they want to remove, searches for the student with the given ID, and removes them from the list of students.


The menu() function displays the menu options and prompts the user to enter their choice.
The main() function creates a new StudentSystem object, maps the menu options to the corresponding
methods of the StudentSystem object, and executes the corresponding method based on the user's choice.
The program runs until the user chooses to exit.



## Conclusion
Overall, this project provides a simple and user-friendly for setting or managing Student.

All The Best
